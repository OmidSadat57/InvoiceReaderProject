## Goals

### Primary

Our primary goal is to build and compare different models for reading / extracting specific data conatined in an invoice

### Invoice Data Generation
1. Select invoice (Amazon, Apple, Xing, ...)
2. Create template (.docx)
3. Write script for invoice generation
4. Create data frames (Person, Product) with pseudo data
5. Generate invoice pdf files
6. Convert invoice files to .png files

### Model Building
1. Method: Deep Learning
  *  Pump different invoice types into Model
  *  Callibrate Model to increase performance
2. Method: Ruleset
  *  Write a logical Ruleset for each invoice variation
  *  Save output into csv file for performance examination

### Analysis
- Compare both models:
  *  Strengths vs. Weaknesses?
  *  how do the performances compare?
